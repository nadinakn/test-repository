## Context
<!--- Describe the context of the user story in detail. 
*Example*
We currently report the code coverage in our Jenkins Jobs with cobertura and junit with Jest. This allows us to see the code coverage overtime in the Jenkins console. It would be nice if we had access to code coverage in other places like github status checks and teams. -->

## AC
<!-- Acceptance Criteria lets us know what needs to be done but not how. It should also explain the value it brings.
*Example*
- CI/CD pipeline reports Code Coverage in the Teams Notification so that Developers understand how their feature impacts the Code Coverage score.
- CI/CD pipeline fails builds if Code Coverage is less than 80% so that we are confident the new features are tested. -->

## Tasks
<!--- Define a checklist you can use to coordinate and track parts of this user story
*Example*
- [ ] Modify NPM library to collect code coverage report
- [ ] Modify Feature Pipeline to send code coverage report in Teams notification
- [ ] Modify Feature Pipeline to fails jobs if Code Coverage percentage is below 80% -->
